# **Job Recommendation System for Data Scientists**

## 1. **Project Title**:
   - *Job Recommendation System for Data Scientists*

## 2. **Introduction**:
   - This project aims to develop a personalized job recommendation system tailored specifically for data scientists. The system leverages advanced machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to match candidates with the most relevant job opportunities. The primary focus is on enhancing recommendation precision while promoting diversity and inclusion.

## 3. **Project Structure**:
   - The project is organized into the following directories:
     - **data/**: https://github.com/Kilavuka/DSC-Phase-5-Capstone-Project/blob/main/jd_structured_data.csv
     - **notebooks/**: https://github.com/Kilavuka/DSC-Phase-5-Capstone-Project/blob/main/notebook.ipynb
     - **ppt/**: https://github.com/Kilavuka/DSC-Phase-5-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Job%20Recommender%20presentation.pptx
     - **src/**: https://github.com/Kilavuka/DSC-Phase-5-Capstone-Project/blob/main/svd_job_title_model.pkl
     - **weblink/**:https://jobrecommenderapp.azurewebsites.net/
     - **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

## 4. **Requirements**:
   - The project requires the following tools and libraries:
     - Python 3.8+
     - Jupyter Notebook
     - pandas
     - numpy
     - scikit-learn
     - nltk
     - textblob
     - matplotlib
     - seaborn

## 5. **Installation**:
   - **Step 1**: Clone the repository.
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Kilavuka/DSC-Phase-5-Capstone-Project.git
     ```
   - **Step 2**: Navigate to the project directory.
     ```bash
     cd Job-Recommendation-System
     ```
   - **Step 3**: Set up a virtual environment.
     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     ```
   - **Step 4**: Activate the virtual environment and install dependencies.
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate   # On Linux/MacOS
     env\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## 6. **Usage**:
   - **Step 1**: Start Jupyter Notebook.
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - **Step 2**: Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to preprocess the data, build the model, and evaluate its performance.

## 7. **Objective**:
   - The objective of this project is to analyze job descriptions and user profiles to recommend the most suitable job opportunities to data scientists. The system also aims to ensure fair and unbiased recommendations, promoting diversity in hiring.

## 8. **Problem Definition**:
   - The project addresses the challenge of matching data scientists with the right job opportunities. In the fast-growing field of data science, it is crucial to accurately match candidates with roles that fit their skills and career goals. The system focuses on enhancing recommendation accuracy, reducing bias, and improving user experience.

## 9. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, resolving encoding issues (such as `cp1252`), and skipping malformed lines. The text data in job descriptions is tokenized, cleaned, and prepared for NLP analysis.

## 10. **NLP Analysis**:
    - NLP techniques are used to analyze job descriptions and user profiles. The analysis extracts key skills, qualifications, and job requirements, which are then used to build the recommendation model. Tools like `nltk` and `textblob` are utilized for sentiment analysis and feature extraction.

## 11. **Job Matching Precision**:
    - The system implements machine learning models, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches, to enhance the precision of job recommendations.

## 12. **Visualization**:
    - Visualizations such as bar graphs and scatter plots are used to represent the distribution of job recommendations, salary trends, and the impact of various features on the recommendations.

## 13. **Conclusion**:
    - The project successfully builds a personalized job recommendation system that improves job matching precision for data scientists. The system also addresses bias and promotes diversity in job recommendations. Future work includes integrating more user feedback and refining the model for better performance.

## 14. **Research Questions**:
    - How accurately can we match data scientists with job opportunities using a machine learning-based recommendation system?
    - How does the system ensure fairness and reduce bias in recommendations?
    - What impact does user feedback have on improving the model over time?

## 15. **Recommendations for Further Analysis**:
    - Incorporate additional features such as user preferences for location and company type.
    - Extend the model to support recommendations for other tech roles, such as data engineers and machine learning engineers.
    - Integrate real-time job postings and update the recommendations accordingly.

## 16. **Troubleshooting**:
    - For common issues, refer to the FAQ section in the documentation or open an issue on GitHub.
