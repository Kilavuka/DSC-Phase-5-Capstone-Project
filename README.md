 Overview
Our project aims to develop a personalized job recommendation system specifically designed for data scientists. The system leverages advanced machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to match candidates with the most relevant job opportunities, enhancing the precision of job recommendations while promoting diversity and inclusion.
Project Objectives
1. Personalized Recommendation Algorithm: Develop a machine learning-based recommender system tailored to data scientists' profiles, matching them with suitable job opportunities.
2. Job Matching Precision: Utilize advanced NLP techniques to analyze job descriptions and user profiles, improving the accuracy of job recommendations.
3. User Experience Enhancement: Design an intuitive user interface that allows easy input of preferences, job recommendations, and feedback to refine the algorithm.
4. Continuous Learning Integration: Implement a feedback loop where the system continuously learns from user interactions to improve future recommendations.
5. Diversity and Inclusion: Address and mitigate biases in job recommendations to ensure fair and equitable candidate-job matching.
6. Performance Evaluation: Develop and track metrics such as user satisfaction, recommendation accuracy, and successful job placements.
Dataset
The dataset we used in this project is sourced from a structured job data file (`jd_structured_data.csv`). It includes job descriptions, titles, company ratings, locations, and estimated salaries. The data is processed using Python's `pandas` library, with steps to handle any inconsistencies or encoding issues.
Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding issues (`cp1252`), and skipping malformed lines.
NLP Analysis: Analyzing job descriptions and user profiles to extract key skills, qualifications, and job requirements.
Machine Learning Model: Building a recommendation model using techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.
User Interface: A streamlined interface for users to input their preferences and receive job recommendations.
Feedback Loop: Incorporating user feedback into the model to enhance the recommendation accuracy over time.
Bias Mitigation: Implementing strategies to ensure the system promotes diversity and avoids discriminatory recommendations.
Usage
1. Preprocess the Data: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. Build the Model: Train the recommendation model using the processed data.
3. Interface Interaction: Use the UI to input preferences and receive job recommendations.
4. Feedback Incorporation: Continuously improve the model by incorporating user feedback.
